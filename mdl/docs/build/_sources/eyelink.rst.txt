How Eyelink works
-----------------

   <div class="col-md-12">

The EyeLink trackers use a velocity-based method for eye event parsing. Saccade onset is detected when the eye movement 
velocity or acceleration exceeds a pre-set threshold, whereas saccade offset is detected when the velocity and acceleration
fall below the thresholds. The end of a saccade is the start of a fixation and the start of a saccade is the end of a 
previous fixation. Since this velocity-based method detects the onset and offset of saccades, it is usually known as a 
"saccade-picker" (`Eyelink forum <https://www.sr-support.com/forum/eyelink/eyelink-usage/53415-official-documentation-of-how-eyelink-calculates-fixations-and-saccades>`_).

heuristic filtering algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The eye movement data recorded in the data file, by default, has been filtered with a heuristic algorithm (Stampe, 1993).
For more information on the heuristic filtering algorithm, see (`Stampe, 1993 <https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03204486>`_).::
